# Hospice
## **Introduction**

Healthcare is the most critical aspect of our society, and many health care providers face challenges to offer practical and active services to patients. Considering a multispeciality hospital, many people enter and exit the hospital in a day, and maintaining their records safely is tedious. To reduce this type of burden and to manage the financial, hospital administration, and clinical aspects, the Hospital management system came into existence. A Hospital management system will benefit Hospitals or clinics by increasing Processing Speed and Results, Cost Effective, Reduction in Errors, Data Security and Retrieving Ability, Improved Patient Care with Quality and Compliance. 

**Requirement Analysis & Objectives**

**Purpose**: The main purpose of this project is the ultimate hospital management system. Actually, there are not many organized management systems in our country’s hospitals. Moreover, the systems which exist are neither so interactive to the user nor so secure. So, we have taken a decision to make a project such that we can provide management to the hospitals of our country that is far better secure, easy to use, well-organized, and pretty much interactive to the user. Furthermore, we want to include some features such as a generalized login system, multilingual functionality, voice assistance, etc.

**Intended users:** The project name is suggesting that it will be used in every hospital for the overall management systems. So, everyone connected to that hospital along with the patient can use the interface of our project. However, in particular,  the users will be the Patients, the Doctors,  the Admin/Owner, the Manager, the Nurses, the Lab Assistants, the Pharmacists and the Workers(Cleaner , Gateman etc.).

**Intensions**: In this project, we want to demonstrate a complete “Hospital Management System”. By using this project a hospital can manage and manipulate its data so much easily. For instance, managing patients' data, doctor’s appointments, manipulating charges, getting prescriptions and other services, multi-lingual facilities, the voice assistance system etc. will be handled in this project. In a nutshell, a complete management system will be found in this project by which sufferings will be lessened for both patients as well as hospital authorities. 

**Project Features:**



1. Easy but compact Graphical User Interface
2. Well-documented code with Software engineering best practices implemented. Ideal for further development.
3. Use of Encryption in Database for maximum security.
4. Multi-user ( 8 real world user entity) platform
5. Available in 2 languages (Bangla and English)
6. Print support for reports and other documents.
7. Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism are applied rightly


## **System Design: **
The below page is showing the generalized login page for everyone involving the patients and all kinds of employees such as doctors, nurses, receptionists, lab managers, pharmacists, hospital admin, workers, etc. Each of them will contain a unique id(UID) and password(PASS) to see the corresponding data one requires according to one's field. There will be a Sign Up page for the patients too. Moreover, there will be a database to store the data of all kinds of fields.

In this project, we are planning to include 8 different types of GUI (Graphical User Interface) for all the 8 kinds of entities that are directly connected to the login page. Here also a database will be connected to the GUIs. Every interface will give some functionality according to the entity’s duty and convenience. Thus a multi-user system will be established.

The class diagram and the GUI for the Patient class are shown beside.
//Image
The class diagram of the Employee class and all the classes that will extend the Employee class is drawn below. 7 Classes will be inherited from the Employee Class. One sample class diagram and GUI for the subclass “Doctor” are given below. The class diagram and GUI of other subclasses will be similar to the doctor with slight changes. They will be updated in the report as per the project progression.

## **Conclusion and Future Work**

Apart from learning new languages and technology, this project taught us collaboration, pressure handling, peer communication, and many other important qualities a software engineer should have. We hope we can implement these learnings in our life in the future.
